# Accessibility

### Accessibility Standards
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA Compliance:** The application will aim for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance to ensure usability for a wide range of users, including those with disabilities.
- **Semantic HTML:** Proper semantic HTML5 elements will be used to convey meaning and structure.
- **ARIA Attributes:** WAI-ARIA attributes will be applied where native HTML semantics are insufficient.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements will be fully navigable and operable via keyboard alone, with logical tab order.
- **Focus Management:** Clear visual focus indicators will be provided for all interactive elements.
- **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for text and interactive elements).
- **Text Resizing:** Users should be able to resize text up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.

### Accessibility Testing
- **Automated Testing:** Tools like Lighthouse, Axe-core, or Pa11y will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for automated accessibility checks.
- **Manual Testing:** Regular manual audits will be conducted using screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver) and keyboard-only navigation.
- **User Testing:** User testing with individuals with disabilities will be conducted to gather real-world feedback.
