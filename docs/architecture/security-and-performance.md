# Security and Performance

### Security Requirements
**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';`
- XSS Prevention: React's automatic escaping, sanitize user-generated content.
- Secure Storage: Use `localStorage` for non-sensitive tokens (short-lived access tokens), `httpOnly` cookies for refresh tokens.

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Joi/Yup for schema validation on all incoming API requests.
- Rate Limiting: Express-rate-limit middleware for API endpoints.
- CORS Policy: Restrict origins to known frontend domains.
- **Data Encryption:** All data at rest (DynamoDB, S3) will be encrypted using AWS KMS. Data in transit will be encrypted using TLS/HTTPS.
- **Sensitive Data Handling:** PCI DSS compliance will be considered for simulated payment data. No sensitive user data will be logged directly.
- **Access Control:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) will be implemented based on user roles (Buyer, Store Manager, Admin) to restrict access to specific API endpoints and data.

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: Access tokens in memory/localStorage (short-lived), refresh tokens in `httpOnly` cookies.
- Session Management: JWT-based stateless sessions.
- Password Policy: Minimum 8 characters, mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Hashing with bcrypt.
- **Infrastructure Security:** Network segmentation using VPCs and subnets. Security Groups will be configured for least privilege access. AWS WAF will be used for common web exploits.

### Performance Optimization
**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: < 500KB (gzipped)
- Loading Strategy: Lazy loading for routes and components, code splitting.
- Caching Strategy: Service Workers for PWA caching, HTTP caching for static assets.

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: < 100ms for critical APIs
- Database Optimization: Proper indexing, efficient queries, connection pooling.
- Caching Strategy: Redis for frequently accessed data (e.g., product details, user sessions).
