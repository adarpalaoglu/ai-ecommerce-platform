# Deployment Architecture

### Deployment Strategy
**Frontend Deployment:**
- **Platform:** AWS Amplify (or Vercel/Netlify)
- **Build Command:** `nx build web`
- **Output Directory:** `dist/apps/web`
- **CDN/Edge:** CloudFront

**Backend Deployment:**
- **Platform:** AWS Lambda via Serverless Framework/AWS CDK
- **Build Command:** `nx build api`
- **Deployment Method:** Serverless deployment (e.g., `serverless deploy` or `cdk deploy`)

### Environments
| Environment | Frontend URL | Backend URL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Development | `http://localhost:4200` | `http://localhost:3000/api` | Local development |
| Staging | `https://staging.ecommerce.com` | `https://api.staging.ecommerce.com/v1` | Pre-production testing |
| Production | `https://www.ecommerce.com` | `https://api.ecommerce.com/v1` | Live environment |

### Rollback and Recovery
- **Rollback Strategy:** Automated rollbacks will be configured for failed deployments via CI/CD pipelines. Manual rollbacks will be supported by deploying previous stable versions.
- **Recovery Procedures:** Disaster recovery plans will include regular backups of DynamoDB and S3, and infrastructure rehydration using AWS CDK. RTO and RPO objectives will be defined.

### Reliability and Resilience
- **Retry Policies:** Implemented for external API calls and database operations with exponential backoff.
- **Circuit Breakers:** Applied to critical external service integrations to prevent cascading failures.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Core functionalities will remain operational even if non-critical services are degraded or unavailable.
- **System Recovery:** Automated health checks and auto-scaling will ensure the system can recover from instance failures and handle traffic spikes.
