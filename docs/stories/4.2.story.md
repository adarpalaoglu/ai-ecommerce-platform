Title: Frontend Product Management Interface
---

### Story

**As a** store manager,
**I want** a simple interface where I can see a list of all products and have options to add a new one or edit an existing one,
**so that** I can easily manage the product catalog without using the API directly.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new "Manage Products" page is created in the frontend application, accessible only to logged-in managers/admins.
2.  The page displays a table or list of all products, fetched from the `GET /api/products` endpoint.
3.  The interface includes forms for adding a new product and editing an existing one, which call the appropriate backend endpoints.
4.  User-friendly feedback is provided for successful or failed operations (e.g., "Product successfully created").

### Dev Notes

#### Previous Story Insights

- No specific insights from previous stories directly relevant to product management UI.

#### Data Models

- `Product` model: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `imageUrl`, `category`, `stock`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- Type Sharing: Always define types in `packages/shared/src/types`. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

#### API Specifications

- `GET /api/products` endpoint to fetch all products. [Source: docs/prd/epic-1.md, docs/prd/epic-4.md]
- `POST /api/products` endpoint to add a new product. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4.md]
- `PUT /api/products/:id` endpoint to update an existing product. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4.md]
- API Calls: Never make direct HTTP calls from components; use the service layer (`apps/web/src/services`). [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Error Handling: All API routes must use the standard error handler for consistent error responses. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

#### Component Specifications

- Frontend Framework: React (18.x), UI Component Library: Material-UI (5.x). [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Component Organization: `src/components/` for reusable UI components, `src/pages/` for page-level components. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- State Management: Zustand stores for global application state. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md, architecture/tech-stack.md]
- State Updates: Never mutate state directly; use proper state management patterns (e.g., Zustand setters, React `useState` setters). [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

#### File Locations

- New "Manage Products" page will go into `apps/web/src/pages/products/ManageProductsPage.tsx`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md, architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- API client services for backend communication will be in `apps/web/src/services/`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md, architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- New components for product management forms/table will go into `apps/web/src/components/specific/product-management/`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md, architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

#### Testing Requirements

- Frontend Testing: Jest, React Testing Library for unit and integration testing. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Test Organization: `apps/web/tests/unit/` and `apps/web/tests/integration/`. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

#### Technical Constraints

- Frontend Language: TypeScript (5.x). [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS (3.x). [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Tasks / Subtasks

1.  (AC: 1) Create "Manage Products" page.
    *   [ ] Create `apps/web/src/pages/products/ManageProductsPage.tsx`.
    *   [ ] Implement basic page structure and routing.
    *   [ ] Ensure page is accessible only to logged-in managers/admins (integrate with authentication/authorization).
2.  (AC: 2) Display list of all products.
    *   [ ] Create `productService` in `apps/web/src/services/` to fetch products from `GET /api/products`.
    *   [ ] Implement product listing component (e.g., table or grid) in `apps/web/src/components/specific/product-management/ProductList.tsx`.
    *   [ ] Integrate `ProductList` component into `ManageProductsPage`.
    *   [ ] Display product image, name, description, price, and stock.
3.  (AC: 3) Implement forms for adding and editing products.

    *   [ ] Create "Edit Product" form component in `apps/web/src/components/specific/product-management/EditProductForm.tsx`.
    *   [ ] Implement logic to call `POST /api/products` for adding products.
    *   [ ] Implement logic to call `PUT /api/products/:id` for editing products.
    *   [ ] Integrate forms into `ManageProductsPage` (e.g., via modals or separate routes).
4.  (AC: 4) Provide user-friendly feedback.
    *   [ ] Implement success/failure notifications for add/edit operations.
5.  Write tests for the new components and pages.
    *   [ ] Add unit tests for `ManageProductsPage`.
    *   [ ] Add unit tests for `ProductList` component.
