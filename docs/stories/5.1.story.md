Dev Notes:
*   **Design Brief Reference**: For detailed visual and interaction design specifications, refer to `docs/front-end-spec/verve-design-brief.md`.
*   **Previous Story Insights**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs
*   **Data Models**: The `Product` data model from `docs/architecture/data-models.md` will be used for displaying product information.
    *   `Product` attributes: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `imageUrl`, `category`, `stock`. [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Product]
*   **API Specifications**: The frontend will continue to consume the `GET /api/products` endpoint for product display on the homepage. [Source: components.md#Product Catalog Service]
*   **Component Specifications**:
    *   Frontend components are organized under `apps/web/src/components/`. [Source: frontend-architecture.md#Component Organization]
    *   Reusable UI components are in `apps/web/src/components/common/`. [Source: frontend-architecture.md#Component Organization]
    *   Page-level components (e.g., `HomePage`) are in `apps/web/src/pages/`. [Source: frontend-architecture.md#Component Organization]
    *   State management for global state uses Zustand stores. [Source: frontend-architecture.md#State Management Architecture]
    *   Styling uses Tailwind CSS. [Source: tech-stack.md#CSS Framework]
*   **File Locations**:
    *   Homepage related files: `apps/web/src/pages/HomePage.tsx` [Source: frontend-architecture.md#Route Organization]
    *   Navigation components: `apps/web/src/components/layout/` (assumed based on common component organization) [Source: frontend-architecture.md#Component Organization]
*   **Testing Requirements**:
    *   Frontend testing uses Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests. [Source: tech-stack.md#Frontend Testing]
    *   E2E testing uses Cypress. [Source: tech-stack.md#E2E Testing]
    *   Visual Regression Testing will be used to detect unintended UI changes. [Source: testing-strategy.md#Visual Regression Testing]
    *   Accessibility Testing will be performed. [Source: testing-strategy.md#Accessibility Testing]
    *   Test files for components are in `apps/web/src/components/<Component>/<Component>.test.tsx`. [Source: testing-strategy.md#Frontend Tests]
    *   Test files for pages are in `apps/web/src/pages/<Page>/<Page>.test.tsx`. [Source: testing-strategy.md#Frontend Tests]
*   **Technical Constraints**:
    *   Frontend Language: TypeScript 5.x, React 18.x. [Source: tech-stack.md#Frontend Language, Frontend Framework]
    *   UI Component Library: Material-UI 5.x. [Source: tech-stack.md#UI Component Library]
    *   State Management: Zustand 4.x. [Source: tech-stack.md#State Management]
    *   Type Sharing: Always define types in `packages/shared/src/types`. [Source: coding-standards.md#Type Sharing]
    *   API Calls: Never make direct HTTP calls from components; use the service layer (`apps/web/src/services`). [Source: coding-standards.md#API Calls]
