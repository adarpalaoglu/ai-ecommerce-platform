Title: Frontend Application Setup
---

### Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the initial React (TypeScript) application with basic routing and a UI component library,
**so that** we have a structured and visually consistent foundation for the frontend.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new React project is created using TypeScript.
2.  React Router v6 is configured to handle basic navigation.
3.  A UI component library (e.g., Material-UI or Ant Design) is installed and configured.
4.  The project has a basic layout structure, including a header, main content area, and footer.

### Dev Notes

#### Previous Story Insights

Stories 1.1 and 1.2 established the backend API, including product endpoints and database seeding. This provides the necessary backend services for the frontend to consume.

#### Data Models

-   **Product:** Represents a product available for sale. Key attributes: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `imageUrl`, `category`, `stock`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
-   **User:** Represents a user of the e-commerce platform. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

#### API Specifications

- The frontend will interact with the REST API defined in `docs/architecture/api-specification.md`.

#### Component Specifications

- The frontend application will be built using reusable UI components. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

#### File Locations

-   The frontend application code should be located in `apps/web/src`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
-   Reusable UI components should be placed in `apps/web/src/components/`. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
-   Page-level components should be in `apps/web/src/pages/`. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

#### Testing
-   Frontend testing will use Jest and React Testing Library. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
-   Unit tests for components should be co-located with the component files (e.g., `Button.test.tsx`). [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

#### Technical Constraints

-   **Frontend Language:** TypeScript [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   **Frontend Framework:** React [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   **UI Component Library:** Material-UI [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   **State Management:** Zustand [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   **CSS Framework:** Tailwind CSS [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   **Naming Conventions:** Components should be `PascalCase`. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
