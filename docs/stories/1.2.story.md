Title: Public Product API Endpoints
---

### Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to create public API endpoints to fetch a list of all products and the details of a single product,
**so that** the frontend application can display product information to users.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A `GET /api/products` endpoint exists that returns a paginated, JSON-formatted list of all products.
2.  The `GET /api/products` endpoint supports basic filtering by category and sorting by price.
3.  A `GET /api/products/:id` endpoint exists that returns the complete details of a single product in JSON format.
4.  These endpoints are public and do not require authentication.
5.  A script is created to seed the database with at least 10 sample products for testing.

### Dev Notes

#### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.1 set up the FastAPI project, connected to PostgreSQL, and created `products` and `categories` tables. It also included a basic seeding script.

#### Data Models

-   **Product:** Represents a product available for sale. Key attributes: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `imageUrl`, `category`, `stock`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

#### API Specifications

-   REST API Specification: `openapi: 3.0.0`, `title: E-commerce API`, `version: 1.0.0`. Base URL: `https://api.ecommerce.com/v1`. [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md]

#### Component Specifications

No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

#### File Locations

Backend code should be located in `apps/api/src`. Individual Lambda functions (though we are using FastAPI, this implies API endpoints) should be organized under `src/functions/products/`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md, docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]

#### Testing Requirements

-   Backend Testing: Jest, Supertest for unit and integration testing for Node.js APIs. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
-   Test Organization: Backend tests should be in `apps/api/tests/unit/` or `apps/api/tests/integration/`. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
-   Test Examples: Backend API Test example provided for `GET /products`. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

#### Technical Constraints

-   Backend framework: FastAPI (from previous story context and PRD).
-   Database: PostgreSQL (from previous story context and PRD).
-   API Style: REST. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   Naming Conventions: API Routes should be `kebab-case`. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Tasks / Subtasks

1.  (AC: 1) Implement `GET /api/products` endpoint.
    *   [x] Create a new route in `apps/api/src/main.py` or a dedicated router.
    *   [x] Implement pagination logic.
    *   [x] Implement filtering by category.
    *   [x] Implement sorting by price.
    *   [x] Ensure the response is JSON-formatted.
2.  (AC: 3) Implement `GET /api/products/:id` endpoint.
    *   [x] Create a new route for fetching a single product by ID.
    *   [x] Ensure the response includes complete product details in JSON format.
3.  (AC: 4) Ensure endpoints are public and do not require authentication.
    *   [x] Verify that no authentication middleware is applied to these routes.
4.  (AC: 5) Create a script to seed the database with at least 10 sample products for testing.
    *   [x] Update `scripts/seed.py` to include sample product data.
    *   [x] Ensure the script can be run independently.
5.  Create unit and integration tests for the new endpoints.
    *   [x] Write unit tests for product fetching logic.
    *   [x] Write integration tests for `GET /api/products` (including pagination, filtering, sorting).
    *   [x] Write integration tests for `GET /api/products/:id`.
    *   [x] Ensure tests adhere to the testing strategy and naming conventions.

### QA Results

### Review Date: Wednesday, August 6, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation of the product API endpoints and the seeding script is well-done. The tests are comprehensive and cover the acceptance criteria effectively.

### Refactoring Performed

-   **File**: `apps/api/src/main.py` and `apps/api/src/functions/products/routes.py`
    -   **Change**: Moved product API routes from `main.py` to a new dedicated file `routes.py` within `src/functions/products/`.
    -   **Why**: To adhere to the project's unified project structure and backend architecture guidelines, which suggest organizing individual API endpoints under `src/functions/products/`. This improves code organization and maintainability.
    -   **How**: The `products_router` and its associated routes were cut from `main.py` and pasted into `routes.py`. `main.py` was then updated to import and include the `products_router` from its new location.

### Compliance Check

-   Coding Standards: ✓
-   Project Structure: ✓ (Addressed by refactoring)
-   Testing Strategy: ✓
-   All ACs Met: ✓

### Improvements Checklist

-   [x] Refactored API routes to adhere to project structure guidelines.

### Security Review

No immediate security concerns found within the scope of this story. Endpoints are correctly set to be public as per AC.

### Performance Considerations

The current implementation for product fetching with pagination, filtering, and sorting seems efficient for initial scale. Further performance optimizations (e.g., indexing, caching) can be considered as data volume grows.

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done
