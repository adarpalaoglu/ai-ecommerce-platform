Title: Backend Product Management
---

### Story

**As a** store manager,
**I want** to be able to add, edit, and view products through the API,
**so that** I can manage the store's catalog.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A `POST /api/products` endpoint is created to add a new product to the database.
2.  A `PUT /api/products/:id` endpoint is created to update an existing product's details.
3.  A `DELETE /api/products/:id` endpoint is created to remove a product.
4.  These endpoints are protected and can only be accessed by users with the "manager" or "admin" role.
5.  The endpoints correctly handle product data, including name, description, price, and stock quantity.

### Dev Notes

#### Previous Story Insights

- No specific insights from previous stories directly relevant to product management.

#### Data Models

- `Product` model: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `imageUrl`, `category`, `stock`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

#### API Specifications

- New endpoints: `POST /api/products`, `PUT /api/products/:id`, `DELETE /api/products/:id`. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4.md]
- API Routes use `kebab-case`. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All API routes must use the standard error handler. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

#### Component Specifications

- No specific UI components for this backend story.

#### File Locations

- New Lambda functions for product management will go into `apps/api/src/functions/products/`. [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md, architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Any new business logic for product management will go into `apps/api/src/services/`. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- New data models/interfaces (if any) will go into `apps/api/src/models/` or `packages/shared/src/types/`. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

#### Testing Requirements

- Backend Tests: Unit tests for Lambda functions and business logic. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test Organization: `apps/api/tests/unit/` and `apps/api/tests/integration/`. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Testing frameworks: Jest, Supertest. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Specific Test Scenarios:**
**For `POST /api/products` (AC: 1, 4, 5):**
- **Positive:**
    - Verify a manager/admin user can successfully add a new product.
    - Verify the response contains the newly created product details.
    - Verify the product is correctly stored in the database.
    - Verify the endpoint handles a large number of product creations efficiently (performance consideration).
- **Negative:**
    - Verify a non-manager/non-admin user receives a 403 Forbidden error.
    - Verify the endpoint returns a 400 Bad Request for invalid product data (e.g., missing name, negative price).
- **Edge Cases:**
    - Verify handling of duplicate product names (if applicable, based on business rules).

**For `PUT /api/products/:id` (AC: 2, 4, 5):**
- **Positive:**
    - Verify a manager/admin user can successfully update an existing product's details.
    - Verify the database reflects the updated product details.
- **Negative:**
    - Verify a non-manager/non-admin user receives a 403 Forbidden error.
    - Verify the endpoint returns a 404 Not Found if the product ID does not exist.
    - Verify the endpoint returns a 400 Bad Request for invalid update data.
- **Edge Cases:**
    - Verify handling of partial updates.

**For `DELETE /api/products/:id` (AC: 3, 4):**
- **Positive:**
    - Verify a manager/admin user can successfully remove a product.
    - Verify the product is removed from the database.
- **Negative:**
    - Verify a non-manager/non-admin user receives a 403 Forbidden error.
    - Verify the endpoint returns a 404 Not Found if the product ID does not exist.

**Necessary Test Data:**
- **Users:** At least one user with "manager" role, at least one user with "admin" role, at least one user with a "customer" role.
- **Products:** Sample products for creation, update, and deletion.
- **Authentication Tokens:** Valid and invalid JWT tokens for each user role.

#### Technical Constraints

- Backend: Node.js (Express), TypeScript, DynamoDB. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Authentication and Authorization: Use JWT tokens and middleware/guards for role-based access control ("manager" or "admin" roles). [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Type Sharing: Always define types in `packages/shared/src/types`. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Security Considerations:**
- **Data Protection:** Ensure sensitive product data is handled securely. Implement input validation and sanitization.
- **Vulnerability Prevention:** Implement rate limiting. Utilize secure coding practices. Regularly update dependencies. Ensure proper error handling.
