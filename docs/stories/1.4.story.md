Title: Product Listing Page
---

### Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to view a list of available products,
**so that** I can browse and select items to purchase.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  The application displays a "Products" page accessible via navigation.
2.  The "Products" page fetches and displays a list of products from the backend API.
3.  Each product in the list shows its name, image, price, and a brief description.
4.  Users can navigate to a detailed product page by clicking on a product.

### Dev Notes

#### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.3 established the initial React (TypeScript) application with basic routing and Material-UI. This story will build upon that foundation by integrating with the backend product API.

#### Data Models

-   **Product:** Represents a product available for sale. Key attributes: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `imageUrl`, `category`, `stock`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

#### API Specifications

-   The frontend will interact with the REST API defined in `docs/architecture/api-specification.md`.
-   To fetch products, the `GET /products` endpoint will be used. [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md]

#### Component Specifications

-   A `ProductCard` component will be created to display individual product details. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
-   A `ProductListPage` component will orchestrate the fetching and display of products. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

#### File Locations

-   The `ProductListPage` component should be located in `apps/web/src/pages/products/ProductListPage.tsx`. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
-   The `ProductCard` component should be located in `apps/web/src/components/products/ProductCard.tsx`. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
-   API service for products should be in `apps/web/src/services/productService.ts`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

#### Testing

-   Unit tests for `ProductCard` and `ProductListPage` components. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
-   Integration tests for the product fetching service. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

#### Security Considerations

-   Identify and address any security implications related to product data fetching and display (e.g., input validation for any future search/filter parameters, data exposure).

#### Technical Constraints

-   **Frontend Language:** TypeScript [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   **Frontend Framework:** React [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   **UI Component Library:** Material-UI [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   **State Management:** Zustand [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   **CSS Framework:** Tailwind CSS [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   **Naming Conventions:** Components should be `PascalCase`. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
-   API calls should be made via the service layer (`apps/web/src/services`). [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
