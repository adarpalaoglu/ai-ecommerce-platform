Title: Backend Order Creation
---

### Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to create the backend infrastructure to handle order creation from a user's cart,
**so that** a user's intention to buy is recorded in the system.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  The `orders` and `order_items` tables are added to the database.
2.  A `POST /api/orders` endpoint is created that takes the current user's cart, creates a new order, and populates the `order_items` table with the cart's contents.
3.  Upon successful order creation, the user's shopping cart is cleared.
4.  The order is created with a default status of "Pending".
5.  The endpoint returns a confirmation of the newly created order.

### Dev Notes

#### Previous Story Insights

Story 2.3 implemented the backend cart functionality, providing the necessary API endpoints for managing a user's shopping cart. This story will consume those endpoints to create an order.

#### Data Models

-   `Order` model: `id`, `userId`, `orderDate`, `totalAmount`, `status`, `shippingAddressId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
-   `OrderItem` model: `id`, `orderId`, `productId`, `quantity`, `price`. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
-   `CartItem` model (from backend): links `User` and `Product` with a `quantity`. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
-   `Product` model: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `imageUrl`, `category`, `stock`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
-   `User` model: `id`, `email`, `passwordHash`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

#### API Specifications

-   API Style: REST 1.0 [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   Backend Framework: Node.js (Express) [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   Authentication: AWS Cognito, JWT-based. Endpoints will need protection. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]
-   New Endpoint: `POST /api/orders` [Source: docs/prd/epic-3.md]
-   Endpoints to consume:
    -   `GET /api/cart` [Source: docs/prd/epic-2.md]
    -   `DELETE /api/cart/items/:id` (for clearing cart) [Source: docs/prd/epic-2.md]

#### Database

-   DynamoDB is the chosen database. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   `orders` and `order_items` tables will be needed. The `database-schema.md` shows examples of DynamoDB table definitions. [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md]
-   Data Access Layer: `DynamoDBClient` and `DynamoDBDocumentClient` are used for CRUD operations. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]

#### File Locations

-   Backend application code is in `apps/api/src/`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
-   Individual Lambda functions are in `apps/api/src/functions/`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
-   Business logic is in `apps/api/src/services/`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
-   Data models are in `apps/api/src/models/`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
-   Order-related functions will be located in `src/functions/orders/`. [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]

#### Testing Requirements

-   Backend Testing: Jest, Supertest for unit and integration testing. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   Test Organization: Unit tests for Lambda functions in `apps/api/src/functions/` and business logic in `apps/api/src/services/`. Integration tests in `apps/api/tests/integration/`. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
-   **Test Data Requirements**:
    -   **Positive Cases**: Create order from a cart with multiple items, create order from an empty cart (should fail).
    -   **Edge Cases**: Insufficient product stock, invalid product IDs in cart.
    -   **Negative Cases**: Unauthorized order creation.

#### Technical Constraints

-   Backend Language: TypeScript 5.x [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   Type Sharing: Always define types in `packages/shared/src/types`. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
-   Error Handling: All API routes must use the standard error handler for consistent error responses. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

#### Security Considerations

-   **Data Protection**: All order data at rest (DynamoDB) will be encrypted using AWS KMS. Data in transit will be encrypted using TLS/HTTPS. [Source: docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md]
-   **Sensitive Data Handling**: No sensitive user data related to the order will be logged directly. [Source: docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md]
-   **Vulnerability Prevention**:
    -   **Input Validation**: Joi/Yup for schema validation on all incoming API requests to order endpoints. [Source: docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md]
    -   **Access Control**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) will be implemented to ensure only authenticated users can create orders. [Source: docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md]

### Tasks / Subtasks

1.  (AC: 1) Add `orders` and `order_items` tables to the database.
    *   Define `Order` and `OrderItem` schemas in `apps/api/src/models/`.
    *   Create database migrations for `orders` and `order_items` tables.
2.  (AC: 2, 3, 4, 5) Implement `POST /api/orders` endpoint.
    *   Create a new Lambda function for order creation in `apps/api/src/functions/orders/`.
    *   Retrieve the current user's cart contents using `GET /api/cart`.
    *   Validate product stock for all items in the cart.
    *   Create a new order entry in the `orders` table with status "Pending".
    *   Populate the `order_items` table with the cart's contents.
    *   Clear the user's shopping cart after successful order creation.
    *   Return a confirmation of the newly created order.
3.  Protect `POST /api/orders` endpoint with JWT authentication.
    *   Implement JWT validation middleware for the new endpoint.
4.  Write unit and integration tests for order creation functionality.
    *   Write unit tests for order service logic.
    *   Write integration tests for `POST /api/orders` endpoint.
