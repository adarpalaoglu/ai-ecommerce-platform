Title: Frontend User Authentication
---

### Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to be able to register for a new account and log in through the website,
**so that** I can access my account and save my shopping cart.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  The frontend has dedicated pages for user registration and login with corresponding forms.
2.  The forms capture the necessary information (e.g., email, password) and call the respective backend API endpoints.
3.  Upon successful login, the JWT is securely stored in the browser (e.g., in an HttpOnly cookie or local storage).
4.  The application state is updated to reflect the user's authenticated status (e.g., showing a "Logout" button).
5.  Appropriate error messages are displayed for failed registration or login attempts.

### Dev Notes

#### Previous Story Insights

Story 2.1 implemented the backend for user registration and JWT-based authentication. The frontend will need to integrate with the `POST /api/auth/register` and `POST /api/auth/login` endpoints.

#### Data Models

-   **User:** The frontend will interact with the `User` data model as defined in the backend. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

#### API Specifications

-   **User Registration:** `POST /api/auth/register` [Source: docs/prd/epic-2.md]
-   **User Login:** `POST /api/auth/login` [Source: docs/prd/epic-2.md]
    -   Returns a JWT access token upon successful authentication.

#### Component Specifications

-   **Component Organization:** Frontend components will be organized under `apps/web/src/components/`. Pages will be under `apps/web/src/pages/`. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
-   **Routing:** Dedicated pages for registration and login will be created under `apps/web/src/pages/auth/`. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
-   **State Management:** Zustand will be used for global state management, including user authentication status. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
-   **API Client:** The `apiClient` in `apps/web/src/services/apiClient.ts` should be used for all backend communication, and it should be configured to include the JWT in the Authorization header for authenticated requests. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

#### File Locations

-   `apps/web/src/pages/auth/RegisterPage.tsx`
-   `apps/web/src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx`
-   `apps/web/src/components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx` (or similar)
-   `apps/web/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` (or similar)
-   `apps/web/src/store/authStore.ts` (for Zustand state management)
-   `apps/web/src/services/authService.ts` (for API calls)

#### UI/UX Design Guidance

-   **Form Layout:**
    -   Minimalist and Focused: Center the form, single-column layout for input fields. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
    -   Clear Headings: Use Material-UI `Typography` for "Register" and "Login" headings. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
    -   Material-UI `Container` and `Box`: Utilize for overall page width control and spacing. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
-   **Input Fields:**
    -   Material-UI `TextField`: Use `variant="outlined"` or `"filled"`, `fullWidth`, `label`, and appropriate `type` (e.g., `email`, `password`). [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
    -   Password Confirmation: Include a "Confirm Password" field for registration. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
    -   "Forgot Password?" Link: Include below the login form. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
    -   Navigation Links: Provide clear links to switch between login and registration forms. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
-   **Buttons:**
    -   Material-UI `Button`: Use `variant="contained"` and `color="primary"` for main action buttons, `fullWidth`. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]

#### User Feedback During Form Submission

-   **Loading States:**
    -   Disable Submit Button: Prevent multiple submissions. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
    -   Loading Indicator: Integrate `CircularProgress` within or next to the submit button. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
-   **Success Messages:**
    -   Material-UI `Snackbar` or `Alert`: Display temporary success messages (e.g., "Registration successful!"). [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
    -   Clear Form/Redirect: Clear fields or redirect after successful registration/login. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
-   **Error Messages:**
    -   Inline Field Errors: Use `TextField` `error` and `helperText` for validation errors. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
    -   General Form Errors: Display a prominent `Alert` component at the top of the form for API-level errors. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
    -   Clear and Actionable: Messages should be clear, concise, and guide resolution. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]

#### Accessibility and Responsiveness

-   **Accessibility (A11y):**
    -   Semantic HTML: Ensure forms use semantic HTML elements. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
    -   Labels and `aria-label`: All input fields should have clear, associated labels. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
    -   Keyboard Navigation: Ensure all form elements are navigable via keyboard. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
    -   Error Announce: Use `aria-live` regions for dynamic error messages. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
-   **Responsiveness:**
    -   Fluid Layouts: Use Material-UI `Grid` for flexible layouts. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
    -   Breakpoints: Utilize Material-UI's breakpoint system for different screen sizes. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]
    -   Mobile-First Design: Design for smaller screens first. [Source: UX Expert Feedback]

#### Error Handling Guidance

-   **Centralized Error Handling:** Implement an Axios interceptor in `apiClient.ts` to catch and standardize API errors. [Source: Architect Feedback]
-   **User-Friendly Messages:** Translate technical error codes into clear, actionable messages. [Source: Architect Feedback]
-   **Logging:** Log detailed error information for debugging. [Source: Architect Feedback]
-   **State Management:** Update application state to reflect error states. [Source: Architect Feedback]

-   **`400 Bad Request` (Invalid Input/Missing Fields):**
    -   **User Display:** Inline field errors using `TextField` `error` and `helperText` if backend provides specific validation messages. Otherwise, a general `Alert` at the top of the form. [Source: Architect Feedback]
    -   **Internal Logic:** Perform client-side validation. Parse backend response to extract specific validation messages. Update form state to mark fields as erroneous. [Source: Architect Feedback]

-   **`401 Unauthorized` (Invalid Credentials/Expired Token):**
    -   **User Display:** For login, display a clear `Alert`: "Invalid email or password. Please try again." [Source: Architect Feedback]
    -   **Internal Logic:** Clear authentication state (`authStore`) and redirect to login page if `401` occurs for an authenticated request. [Source: Architect Feedback]

-   **Network Errors (No Internet Connection):**
    -   **User Display:** Non-dismissible `Alert` or `Snackbar`: "Network error. Please check your internet connection and try again." [Source: Architect Feedback]
    -   **Internal Logic:** Axios `error.request` block. Consider an "offline" state for the application. [Source: Architect Feedback]

-   **General Server Errors (`500 Internal Server Error`):**
    -   **User Display:** Generic `Alert`: "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later." Avoid technical details. [Source: Architect Feedback]
    -   **Internal Logic:** Log extensively. Avoid automatic retries. [Source: Architect Feedback]

-   **Implementation Details:**
    -   `authService.ts`: Wrap `apiClient` calls in `try...catch`. Re-throw custom error types. [Source: Architect Feedback]
    -   Components: Catch errors from `authService` and update local state to display messages. [Source: Architect Feedback]

#### Testing Requirements

-   **Frontend Unit Tests:** Unit tests for React components (e.g., forms, authentication status display) using Jest and React Testing Library. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
-   **Frontend Integration Tests:** Integration tests for pages (e.g., `RegisterPage`, `LoginPage`) to ensure correct API calls and state updates. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
-   **E2E Tests:** E2E tests using Cypress to simulate user registration and login flows. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

#### Technical Constraints

-   **Frontend Language:** TypeScript [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   **Frontend Framework:** React [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   **UI Component Library:** Material-UI [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   **State Management:** Zustand [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   **API Calls:** Use the service layer (`apps/web/src/services`). Never make direct HTTP calls from components. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
-   **Environment Variables:** Access only through configuration objects, never `process.env` directly in application code. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
