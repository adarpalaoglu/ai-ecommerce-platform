Title: Frontend Cart Interaction
---

### Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to be able to add products to my shopping cart and see the cart update immediately,
**so that** I can keep track of the items I want to buy.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  Clicking the "Add to Cart" button on a product page calls the `POST /api/cart/items` endpoint.
2.  The application has a dedicated shopping cart page that displays all items in the cart, fetched from the `GET /api/cart` endpoint.
3.  On the cart page, users can change the quantity of an item or remove it completely, triggering the appropriate API calls.
4.  The cart page displays a subtotal of all items.
5.  A visual indicator (e.g., a badge on a cart icon in the header) shows the number of items in the cart and updates in real-time.

### Dev Notes

#### Previous Story Insights

Story 2.3 implemented the backend cart functionality, providing the necessary API endpoints (`POST /api/cart/items`, `GET /api/cart`, `PUT /api/cart/items/:id`, `DELETE /api/cart/items/:id`) that this frontend story will consume.

#### Data Models

-   `Product` model: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `imageUrl`, `category`, `stock`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
-   `CartItem` model (from backend): links `User` and `Product` with a `quantity`. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

#### API Specifications

-   API Style: REST 1.0 [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   Frontend Framework: React 18.x [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   State Management: Zustand 4.x [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   API Client Setup: `axios` with `baseURL` from `process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` and `Authorization` header for JWT. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
-   Endpoints to consume:
    -   `POST /api/cart/items` [Source: docs/prd/epic-2.md]
    -   `GET /api/cart` [Source: docs/prd/epic-2.md]
    -   `PUT /api/cart/items/:id` [Source: docs/prd/epic-2.md]
    -   `DELETE /api/cart/items/:id` [Source: docs/prd/epic-2.md]

#### Component Specifications

-   Component Organization: `src/components/` for reusable UI components, `src/pages/` for page-level components. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
-   State Management Patterns: Zustand Stores for global state, local component state for UI-specific state. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
-   Routing: `src/router/` for main router configuration, `src/pages/cart/CartPage.tsx` for the cart page. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
-   Frontend Services Layer: API client services in `src/services/` for backend communication. [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

#### File Locations

-   Frontend application code is in `apps/web/src/`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
-   UI components in `apps/web/src/components/`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
-   Page components in `apps/web/src/pages/`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
-   API client services in `apps/web/src/services/`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
-   Zustand stores in `apps/web/src/store/`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
-   Shared types in `packages/shared/src/types/`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

#### Testing Requirements

-   Frontend Testing: Jest, React Testing Library for unit and integration testing. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   Test Organization: Unit tests for components in `apps/web/src/components/` and integration tests for pages in `apps/web/src/pages/`. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-stack.md]
-   E2E Testing: Cypress for end-to-end testing. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   Test Data Requirements:
    -   **Positive Cases**: Adding/removing/updating items in the cart, viewing cart with items, empty cart.
    -   **Edge Cases**: Adding more than available stock, invalid product IDs.
    -   **Negative Cases**: API call failures, network errors.

#### Technical Constraints

-   Frontend Language: TypeScript 5.x [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   Type Sharing: Always define types in `packages/shared/src/types`. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
-   API Calls: Never make direct HTTP calls from components; use the service layer (`apps/web/src/services`). [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
-   State Updates: Never mutate state directly; use proper state management patterns (e.g., Zustand setters, React `useState` setters). [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

#### UI/UX Considerations

-   **Responsive Design**: Ensure all cart-related UI components and pages are responsive and adapt well to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). [Source: docs/front-end-spec/responsiveness-strategy.md]
-   **Accessibility**: Implement accessibility best practices (e.g., ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, proper color contrast) for all cart UI elements to ensure usability for all users. [Source: docs/front-end-spec/accessibility-requirements.md]

### Tasks / Subtasks

    *   [x] Update the global cart state (Zustand store) after adding an item.

### Dev Agent Record

#### Agent Model Used
Gemini 1.5 Flash

#### Debug Log References
- Initial cart icon visibility issues (multiple attempts to locate correct header component).

- `imageUrl` undefined error on cart page (backend `CartItem` schema missing `product` details).
- 422 Unprocessable Entity error on add to cart (backend expecting `product_id` as int, frontend sending string; backend expecting snake_case, frontend sending camelCase).
- Quantity update errors (frontend not sending `product_id` in update request, type mismatches).
- Login/Logout button dynamic rendering.

#### Completion Notes List
- Successfully implemented all core cart functionalities: add, view, update quantity, remove.
- Integrated cart icon and navigation into the main application header.
