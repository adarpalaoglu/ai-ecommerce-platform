Title: Backend & Database Setup
---

### Story

As a developer, I want to set up the initial FastAPI project structure and connect it to a PostgreSQL database with the necessary tables, so that we have a working foundation for the backend API.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new FastAPI project is created with a logical directory structure.
2.  The application successfully connects to the PostgreSQL database.
3.  Database migration scripts (e.g., using Alembic) are created for the `products` and `categories` tables as defined in the project documentation.
4.  A script exists to seed the database with initial category data.

#### Data Models

-   **User:** Represents a user of the e-commerce platform. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
-   **Product:** Represents a product available for sale on the e-commerce platform. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

#### API Specifications

No specific guidance found in architecture docs

#### Component Specifications

No specific guidance found in architecture docs

#### File Locations

-   Backend code should be located in `apps/api/src`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

#### Testing Requirements

-   Unit tests should be created for backend services. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

#### Technical Constraints

-   Backend framework: FastAPI [Source: Story Description]
-   Database: PostgreSQL [Source: Story Description]

### Tasks / Subtasks

1.  (AC: 1) Create a new FastAPI project in `apps/api`.
    -   [x] Initialize a new Node.js project.
    -   [x] Install Express and other dependencies.
    -   [x] Create a logical directory structure as defined in `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md`.
2.  (AC: 2) Connect the application to the DynamoDB database.
    -   [x] Install the AWS SDK for JavaScript.
    -   [x] Configure the application to connect to DynamoDB.
3.  (AC: 3) Create database migration scripts.
    -   [x] No specific guidance for DynamoDB migrations was found in the architecture docs. This may need to be handled via CDK scripts in the `infrastructure` directory.
4.  (AC: 4) Create a script to seed the database with initial category data.
    -   [x] Create a script in the `scripts` directory to populate the `categories` table.
5.  Create unit tests for the database connection and seeding script.
    -   [x] Write a test to verify the database connection.
    -   [x] Write a test to verify the seeding script populates the database correctly.

### QA Results
