Title: Frontend "Buy Now" and Order Confirmation
---

### Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to be able to click a "Buy Now" button to place my order and then be redirected to a confirmation page,
**so that** I know my purchase was successful.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A "Buy Now" button is present on the shopping cart page.
2.  Clicking the "Buy Now" button calls the `POST /api/orders` endpoint.
3.  After a successful order, the user is redirected to a simple "Thank You" or order confirmation page.

### Dev Notes

#### Previous Story Insights

Story 3.1 implemented the backend order creation (`POST /api/orders`), which this story will consume.

#### Frontend Architecture

-   Component Organization: `apps/web/src/pages/cart/CartPage.tsx` for the "Buy Now" button.
-   State Management: Use Zustand stores for managing cart state.
-   Routing: Implement routing for `/cart` and `/confirmation`.
-   API Client: Use `apps/web/src/services/CartService.ts` for API calls.

#### API Specifications

-   `POST /api/orders`: To create an order from the cart.

#### Data Models

-   `Order` model: `id`, `userId`, `orderDate`, `totalAmount`, `status`, `shippingAddressId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
-   `OrderItem` model: `id`, `orderId`, `productId`, `quantity`, `price`.
-   `User` model: `id`, `email`, `passwordHash`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.

#### File Locations

-   Frontend application code is in `apps/web/src/`.
-   Pages in `apps/web/src/pages/`.
-   Services in `apps/web/src/services/`.
-   Shared types in `packages/shared/src/types/`.

#### Testing Requirements

-   Frontend Testing: Jest, React Testing Library for unit and integration testing.
-   Test Organization: Unit tests for components in `apps/web/src/components/` and integration tests for pages in `apps/web/src/pages/`.
-   E2E Testing: Cypress for end-to-end testing of the purchase flow.
-   Test Data Requirements:
    -   Positive Cases: Successful order placement.
    -   Edge Cases: Empty cart checkout attempt.
    -   Negative Cases: Failed order placement (e.g., insufficient stock).

#### Technical Constraints

-   Frontend Language: TypeScript 5.x
-   Frontend Framework: React 18.x
-   UI Component Library: Material-UI 5.x
-   State Management: Zustand 4.x
-   Type Sharing: Always define types in `packages/shared/src/types`.
-   API Calls: Never make direct HTTP calls from components; use the service layer (`apps/web/src/services`).
-   Error Handling: Standard error handling for API responses.

### Tasks / Subtasks

1.  (AC: 1, 2, 3) Implement "Buy Now" functionality on the shopping cart page.
    *   [x] Add a "Buy Now" button to `apps/web/src/pages/cart/CartPage.tsx`.
    *   [x] Implement an `onClick` handler for the "Buy Now" button to call `POST /api/orders` via the frontend service layer.
    *   [x] Handle successful order creation by redirecting the user to a confirmation page (e.g., `/order-confirmation`).
    *   [x] Handle errors during order creation and display appropriate feedback to the user.
2.  Implement frontend service calls for orders.
    *   [x] Add `createOrder` (POST /api/orders) function to `CartService.ts`.
3.  Define shared types for Order and OrderItem.
    *   [x] Ensure `Order` and `OrderItem` interfaces are defined in `packages/shared/src/types/`.
