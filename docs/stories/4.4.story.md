Title: Frontend User Management Interface
---

### Story

**As an** authenticated user,
**I want** an interface to view all users, and as an admin, change their roles,
**so that** I can see system users and manage permissions.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new "Manage Users" page is created, publicly accessible to all authenticated users for viewing purposes.
2.  The page displays a list of all users, fetched from the `GET /api/users` endpoint.
3.  The interface provides a simple way (e.g., a dropdown menu next to each user) to change a user's role. This functionality is only visible and actionable for users with the 'admin' role, and calls the `PUT /api/users/:id/role` endpoint.
4.  Clear feedback is provided upon successful role changes.

### Dev Notes

#### SECURITY WARNING
- **Refined Public Access:** The user management page is publicly accessible to all authenticated users for viewing purposes. However, the functionality to change user roles is strictly restricted to Admin users only. This balances accessibility with security, ensuring critical administrative actions remain protected.

#### Previous Story Insights
- The backend functionality for user management is complete and available.
- The `GET /api/users` and `PUT /api/users/:id/role` endpoints are implemented and protected.

#### Data Models
- `User` model: `id`, `username`, `email`, `hashed_password`, `role` (e.g., "buyer", "manager", "admin"). [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

#### API Specifications
- `GET /api/users`: Fetches a list of all users.
- `PUT /api/users/:id/role`: Updates a user's role.
- Standard API response format (JSON). [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
- Error response structure. [Source: architecture/api-specification.md, architecture/coding-standards.md]

#### Component Specifications
- A new page component `ManageUsersPage.tsx` should be created.
- A reusable `UserList` component could be created to display the users.
- A dropdown component for role selection.
- Material-UI components should be used for consistency. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

#### File Locations
- New page component: `apps/web/src/pages/users/ManageUsersPage.tsx` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- New components: `apps/web/src/components/users/` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- API service calls: `apps/web/src/services/userService.ts` [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- State management: `apps/web/src/store/userStore.ts` (if needed) [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

#### Responsive Design
- **Breakpoints:**
    - **Small (Mobile - up to 600px):** Single-column layout. User list transforms to card-based view.
    - **Medium (Tablet - 601px to 1024px):** Two-column or stacked layout. User list can remain a table, with horizontal scrolling if needed.
    - **Large (Desktop - 1025px and above):** Multi-column layout with full table display.
- **Layout Adaptation:** User table transforms to cards on mobile. Forms scale fluidly. Typography uses relative units.
- **Interaction:** Ensure touch targets are at least 48x48px.

#### Accessibility
- **ARIA Attributes:**
    - Use `<h1>` with `id="main-content-title"` and `aria-labelledby` for page title.
    - Use `role="table"`, `role="columnheader"`, `role="rowheader"` for tables.
    - Use `role="combobox"`, `aria-haspopup="listbox"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `role="option"`, `aria-selected` for role dropdowns.
    - Use `aria-label` for icon-only buttons.
    - Link labels to inputs with `for` and `id`. Use `aria-describedby` for helper/error text.
    - Use `role="status"` or `role="alert"` for dynamic messages.
- **Keyboard Navigation:**
    - Logical `Tab` order for all interactive elements.
    - Clear and visible focus indicator.
    - `Enter`/`Space` for buttons. `Enter`/`Space` to open/close dropdowns, `Arrow Up/Down` to navigate, `Enter` to select, `Escape` to close.
    - Implement "Skip to main content" link.
- **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Descriptive `alt` text for images. DOM order matches visual order. Avoid color-only information. Sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for graphical objects).

#### Test Data Requirements
- **User Roles:** Admin, Manager, Buyer users.
- **Edge Cases (User Data):** Long names/emails, special characters, empty/null fields, large dataset (100+ users), identical names.
- **Successful Role Change:** Admin changes Buyer to Manager, Manager to Buyer, Buyer to Admin, Admin to Manager/Buyer.
- **Failed Role Change:** Unauthorized attempts, invalid role, non-existent user, network interruption, backend validation failure.

#### Data Protection and Vulnerability Prevention
- **Sensitive Data Handling:**
    - Data Minimization: Only fetch/display `id`, `username`, `email`, `role`.
    - Client-Side Storage: Avoid `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` for sensitive data. Use secure, HTTP-only, SameSite=Strict cookies or secure in-memory storage for tokens.
    - Masking/Redaction: Mask sensitive data if displayed.
- **Frontend Vulnerabilities:**
    - **XSS:** Output encoding (React JSX), input sanitization, Content Security Policy (CSP).
    - **CSRF:** CSRF tokens (backend generated, frontend included), SameSite cookies.
    - **Clickjacking:** `X-Frame-Options` or CSP `frame-ancestors`.
    - **IDOR:** Server-side authorization for all requests.
    - **Broken Auth/Session:** Secure session handling (HTTP-only, secure cookies), token expiration, token invalidation.
- **Secure API Communication:**
    - HTTPS Everywhere.
    - API Authentication (JWT, OAuth2).
    - Input Validation (frontend & backend).
    - Generic error messages (no sensitive info leakage).
    - Rate Limiting (backend).

#### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for new components. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Integration tests for the "Manage Users" page. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- E2E tests for the user management flow. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

#### Technical Constraints
- Frontend framework: React with TypeScript. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- UI Component Library: Material-UI. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- State Management: Zustand. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
