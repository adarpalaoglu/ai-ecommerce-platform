Title: Backend Order Management for Store Managers
---

### Story

**As a** store manager,
**I want** to view and manage customer orders,
**so that** I can process incoming purchases.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A `GET /api/orders` endpoint is created that allows users with a "manager" role to view all orders across the system.
2.  A `PUT /api/orders/:id/status` endpoint is created that allows managers to update the status of an order (e.g., from "Pending" to "Shipped").
3.  These endpoints are protected and can only be accessed by users with the "manager" or "admin" role.

### Dev Notes

#### Previous Story Insights

-   Story 3.2 implemented the `POST /api/orders` endpoint for order creation.
-   Order history functionality was removed from the frontend and backend in Story 3.2.
-   Debugging insights from Story 3.2: CORS, `TypeError: 'User' object is not subscriptable`, `ImportError: cannot import name 'OrderResponse'`.

#### Data Models

-   `Order` model: `id`, `userId`, `orderDate`, `totalAmount`, `status`, `shippingAddressId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. The `status` field is a string. [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
-   `User` model: `id`, `email`, `passwordHash`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`. Roles for "manager" or "admin" will need to be considered for authorization. [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

#### API Specifications

-   New endpoints: `GET /api/orders` and `PUT /api/orders/{id}/status`. [Source: docs/prd/epic-3.md]
-   API Routes use `kebab-case`. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
-   All API routes must use the standard error handler. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

#### Component Specifications

-   No specific UI components for this backend story.

#### File Locations

-   New Lambda functions for `GET /api/orders` and `PUT /api/orders/:id/status` will go into `apps/api/src/functions/orders/`. [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md, architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
-   Any new business logic for order management will go into `apps/api/src/services/`. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
-   New data models/interfaces (if any) will go into `apps/api/src/models/` or `packages/shared/src/types/`. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

#### Testing Requirements

-   Backend Tests: Unit tests for Lambda functions and business logic. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
-   Test Organization: `apps/api/tests/unit/` and `apps/api/tests/integration/`. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
-   Testing frameworks: Jest, Supertest. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Specific Test Scenarios:**

**For `GET /api/orders` (AC: 1, 3):**
    -   **Positive:**
        -   Verify a manager/admin user can successfully retrieve a list of all orders.
        -   Verify the response contains expected order details (id, userId, totalAmount, status, etc.).
        -   Verify the endpoint handles a large number of orders efficiently (performance consideration).
    -   **Negative:**
        -   Verify a non-manager/non-admin user receives a 403 Forbidden error when attempting to access the endpoint.
        -   Verify the endpoint returns an appropriate error when an invalid or expired authentication token is provided.
    -   **Edge Cases:**
        -   Verify the endpoint returns an empty list if no orders exist in the system.

**For `PUT /api/orders/:id/status` (AC: 2, 3):**
    -   **Positive:**
        -   Verify a manager/admin user can successfully update the status of an existing order (e.g., from "Pending" to "Shipped").
        -   Verify the database reflects the updated order status.
        -   Verify the endpoint returns the updated order details upon successful update.
    -   **Negative:**
        -   Verify a non-manager/non-admin user receives a 403 Forbidden error when attempting to update an order status.
        -   Verify the endpoint returns a 404 Not Found error if the provided order ID does not exist.
        -   Verify the endpoint returns a 400 Bad Request error for an invalid status transition (e.g., trying to change from "Delivered" to "Pending" if not allowed by business logic).
        -   Verify the endpoint returns an appropriate error when an invalid or expired authentication token is provided.
    -   **Edge Cases:**
        -   Verify the endpoint handles concurrent update requests to the same order gracefully (if applicable, though not explicitly in AC).

**Necessary Test Data:**
-   **Users:**
    -   At least one user with "manager" role.
    -   At least one user with "admin" role.
    -   At least one user with a "customer" role (or no special role).
-   **Orders:**
    -   Multiple orders with various statuses (e.g., "Pending", "Shipped", "Delivered", "Cancelled").
    -   An order that does not exist (for 404 testing).
    -   Orders associated with different users.
-   **Authentication Tokens:** Valid and invalid JWT tokens for each user role.

#### Technical Constraints

-   Backend: Node.js (Express), TypeScript, DynamoDB, AWS Cognito for authentication. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   Authentication and Authorization: Use JWT tokens and middleware/guards for role-based access control ("manager" or "admin" roles). [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
-   Type Sharing: Always define types in `packages/shared/src/types`. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Security Considerations:**
-   **Data Protection:**
    -   Ensure sensitive order data (e.g., shipping address, total amount) is handled securely both in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (DynamoDB encryption).
    -   Implement input validation and sanitization for all incoming data to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection).
    -   Avoid logging sensitive data in plain text.
-   **Vulnerability Prevention:**
    -   Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
    -   Utilize secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities such as broken access control, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure deserialization.
    -   Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
    -   Ensure proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information in error messages.
