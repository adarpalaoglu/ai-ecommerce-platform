# Epic 1: Project Foundation & Core Product Browsing
**Goal:** This epic establishes the foundational infrastructure for both the backend and frontend applications. It includes setting up the database, creating the core API for products, and building the initial user interface for browsing and viewing product information. By the end of this epic, a user will be able to visit the website and see a list of products and their details.

### Story 1.1: Backend & Database Setup
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the initial FastAPI project structure and connect it to a PostgreSQL database with the necessary tables,
**so that** we have a working foundation for the backend API.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new FastAPI project is created with a logical directory structure.
2.  The application successfully connects to the PostgreSQL database.
3.  Database migration scripts (e.g., using Alembic) are created for the `products` and `categories` tables as defined in the project documentation.
4.  A script exists to seed the database with initial category data.

### Story 1.2: Public Product API Endpoints
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create public API endpoints to fetch a list of all products and the details of a single product,
**so that** the frontend application can display product information to users.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A `GET /api/products` endpoint exists that returns a paginated, JSON-formatted list of all products.
2.  The `GET /api/products` endpoint supports basic filtering by category and sorting by price.
3.  A `GET /api/products/:id` endpoint exists that returns the complete details of a single product in JSON format.
4.  These endpoints are public and do not require authentication.
5.  A script is created to seed the database with at least 10 sample products for testing.

### Story 1.3: Frontend Application Setup
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the initial React (TypeScript) application with basic routing and a UI component library,
**so that** we have a structured and visually consistent foundation for the frontend.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new React project is created using TypeScript.
2.  React Router v6 is configured to handle basic navigation.
3.  A UI component library (e.g., Material-UI or Ant Design) is installed and configured.
4.  The project has a basic layout structure, including a header, main content area, and footer.

### Story 1.4: Display Products on Homepage
**As a** user,
**I want** to see a list of featured products when I visit the homepage,
**so that** I can quickly discover items available in the store.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The homepage fetches data from the `GET /api/products` endpoint.
2.  Products are displayed in a clean, grid-based layout.
3.  Each product card in the grid displays the product image, name, and price.
4.  Clicking on a product card navigates the user to the corresponding product detail page.
5.  A loading indicator is shown while the products are being fetched.

### Story 1.5: View Product Details
**As a** user,
**I want** to view a detailed page for a specific product,
**so that** I can get more information before deciding to add it to my cart.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The product detail page fetches data from the `GET /api/products/:id` endpoint based on the product ID in the URL.
2.  The page displays the product's name, multiple images (if available), a detailed description, and price.
3.  An "Add to Cart" button is prominently displayed on the page.
4.  A loading indicator is shown while the product details are being fetched.
