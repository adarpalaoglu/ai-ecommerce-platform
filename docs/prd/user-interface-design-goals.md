# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The user experience should be clean, modern, and intuitive, prioritizing a frictionless path from product discovery to checkout. The design should feel familiar to users of popular e-commerce sites, ensuring that navigation and actions are predictable and easy to understand.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
*   **Browsing:** A standard grid-based layout for product listings with clear filtering and sorting options.
*   **Search:** A prominent search bar that leads to a dedicated results page.
*   **Cart Management:** A slide-out or mini-cart for quick additions, leading to a full-page view for final review and quantity adjustments.
*   **Checkout:** A linear, multi-step process that guides the user through shipping and payment information without distraction.

### Core Screens and Views
*   Homepage (with featured/trending products)
*   Shop/Product Listing Page
*   Product Detail Page
*   Shopping Cart Page
*   User Account Page (Login, Registration, Order History)
*   Store Manager Dashboard (Product & Order Management)

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
To ensure the application is usable by a wide range of people, we will aim for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance as a standard.

### Branding
The branding should be minimal and modern, with a focus on clean typography and a simple color palette that allows the product imagery to stand out. We will avoid overly complex or distracting design elements.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The primary platform will be a responsive web application that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile browsers. A separate React Native application will be developed for a native mobile experience.
