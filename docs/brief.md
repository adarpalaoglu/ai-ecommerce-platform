# Project Brief: Barem

## Executive Summary

Barem is a modern, full-stack e-commerce platform designed to provide a seamless and visually appealing online shopping experience. The project's primary goal is to build a complete, functional online store for electronics, featuring a user-friendly interface for customers and intuitive management tools for store administrators. The target market is general consumers interested in electronics, who value a clean design and a straightforward purchasing process. Barem's key value proposition is its focus on a core, frictionless user journey—from product discovery to checkout—supported by a robust and scalable technical architecture.

## Problem Statement

For developers and software engineering interns, building a comprehensive, portfolio-worthy application from scratch presents a significant challenge. They often face a disjointed learning process, struggling to connect frontend frameworks, backend APIs, and database management into a single, cohesive product. The lack of a well-defined project scope can lead to feature creep, disorganized code, and ultimately, an incomplete or non-functional application. Existing e-commerce platforms solve the problem for consumers, but they don't provide the hands-on, full-stack development experience required to master modern software engineering skills. This project addresses the need for a structured, end-to-end development exercise that mirrors a real-world application.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is to build "Barem," a complete, full-stack e-commerce application. The project will be developed incrementally, focusing on a core set of features to ensure a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

The solution consists of three main components:
1.  **A RESTful Backend API:** Built with **Python and FastAPI**, using a PostgreSQL database. It will handle user authentication, product management, cart functionality, and order processing.
2.  **A Frontend Web Application:** A responsive and modern user interface built with React.js and TypeScript, providing a seamless experience for product discovery, evaluation, and purchase.
3.  **A Mobile Application:** A cross-platform app built with **React Native** that extends the core functionality of the web application to mobile devices, with a focus on browsing, cart management, and order placement.

The key differentiator of this project is its disciplined, MVP-first approach. By strictly prioritizing essential features and deferring non-core functionalities (like real-time notifications or complex analytics), the project is designed to be achievable and result in a high-quality, working application suitable for a professional portfolio.

## Target Users

**Primary Target User (The Developer)**

*   **Profile:** A software engineering intern or developer looking to build a substantial, real-world project for their portfolio.
*   **Goals:** To gain practical, hands-on experience in full-stack development, learn how to integrate various technologies (frontend, backend, database), and create a polished, functional application that demonstrates their skills to potential employers.

## Goals & Success Metrics

**Business Objectives**
*   **Complete a functional MVP:** Deliver a working, bug-free e-commerce application that includes all defined MVP features by the end of the internship/project timeline.
*   **Demonstrate Full-Stack Proficiency:** Create a high-quality codebase that showcases expertise in the chosen technology stack (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, React, React Native) and follows best practices.

**User Success Metrics**
*   **Frictionless Buyer Journey:** A user can successfully navigate the site, find a product, add it to their cart, and complete the (simulated) checkout process without errors or confusion.
*   **Efficient Store Management:** A store manager can log in, add a new product to the catalog, and update an order's status in under 5 minutes.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
*   **MVP Feature Completion:** 100% of the features defined in the "MVP Scope" section are implemented and functional.
*   **End-to-End Transaction Test:** Successful completion of at least 10 test transactions, from user registration to order confirmation, without any critical failures.
*   **Code Quality:** The project passes all linting and formatting checks automatically, with no major code quality issues flagged.

## MVP Scope

**Core Features (Must-Have for MVP)**

*   **Product Discovery & Browsing:** A homepage with curated sections (e.g., "Trending," "Featured"), a main shop page with grid-based product listings, and essential filtering/sorting by category and price.
*   **Search Functionality:** A basic search bar in the header that directs users to a search results page.
*   **Product Detail Page:** A dedicated page for each product showing images, title, price, a detailed description, and simple product options (e.g., color) treated as separate products.
*   **Call to Action Buttons:** An "Add to Cart" button with full functionality. A "Buy It Now" button will also be present in the UI, but it will be non-functional for the MVP.
*   **Shopping Cart:** A full-page cart where users can view items, update quantities, and remove products.
*   **Simulated Checkout:** A multi-step checkout process for shipping information and *simulated* payment, culminating in a "Thank You" page with an order summary.
*   **User Accounts & Order History:** Users can register, log in, and view a history of their past orders with their current status.
*   **Store Manager - Product Management:** A simple interface for store managers to add, view, and edit products, including name, price, and stock quantity.
*   **Store Manager - Order Management:** A basic order dashboard where managers can view incoming orders and update their status (e.g., "Processing" to "Shipped").
*   **Admin - User Management:** A simple user list where an Admin can view all users and change their roles (e.g., promote a buyer to a manager).

**Out of Scope for MVP**

*   Real payment gateway integration (payment will be simulated).
*   **Functional "Buy It Now" button:** The button will exist in the UI but will not trigger a separate checkout flow in the MVP.
*   Real-time features (e.g., "live search," "people are viewing" notifications, WebSockets).
*   Advanced recommendation engines ("You May Also Like" will show items from the same category).
*   Complex reporting and analytics dashboards for managers/admins.
*   Customer reviews and ratings.
*   Wishlist functionality.
*   Email or push notifications for order updates.

**MVP Success Criteria**

The MVP will be considered successful when a user can complete the entire "buyer's journey" from landing on the homepage to placing a simulated order, and a store manager can successfully manage the corresponding product and order on the backend. All core features must be functional and bug-free.

## Post-MVP Vision

**Future Enhancements (The Next Priorities)**

The primary goal of Barem is to serve as a comprehensive, high-quality template for a full-stack e-commerce application. Future work will focus on enhancing this template's quality, depth, and educational value, rather than adding live commercial features.

*   **In-Depth Testing Suite:** Expand the testing coverage to include a full suite of unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests, creating a robust example of a well-tested application.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation:** Set up a complete Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automate testing and builds, demonstrating modern DevOps practices.
*   **Component Library & Storybook:** Refactor the frontend into a reusable component library and document it using Storybook. This would showcase advanced frontend architecture and best practices.
*   **Enhanced "Mock" Features:** Instead of real payment integration, build out more detailed "mock" versions of advanced features. For example, create a fake "Stripe" integration that simulates the API calls and webhook responses of a real payment gateway.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Create extensive developer documentation for the codebase, explaining the architecture, data flow, and setup process, making the project an excellent learning resource for other developers.

**Long-term Vision**

The long-term vision for Barem is to be the "gold standard" template for a modern, full-stack e-commerce project. It will be a go-to resource for developers looking to understand how to build such systems, with a focus on clean code, clear architecture, and best-in-class development practices. The project is not intended to become a live, transactional store.

## Technical Considerations

**Platform Requirements**
*   **Target Platforms:** Web (Desktop & Mobile browsers), Mobile (iOS & Android via React Native).
*   **Browser Support:** Latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
*   **Performance Requirements:** The application should be responsive, with page loads under 3 seconds for a standard internet connection.

**Technology Preferences**
*   **Frontend:** React.js with TypeScript, using Redux Toolkit for state management, React Router v6 for navigation, and Axios for API communication.
*   **Backend:** Python with FastAPI, following RESTful API design principles.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL.
*   **Mobile:** React Native for cross-platform development.
*   **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for securing the API.
*   **Caching:** Redis will be used for session management and cart data to ensure a snappy user experience.

**Architecture Considerations**
*   **Repository Structure:** The project will likely be structured as two separate repositories: one for the FastAPI backend (`barem-api`) and one for the React/React Native frontend (`barem-client`), to maintain a clear separation of concerns.
*   **Service Architecture:** A monolithic backend service providing a RESTful API. This is sufficient and appropriate for the MVP.
*   **Integration Requirements:** No third-party integrations are required for the MVP, as payment and other services will be simulated.
*   **Security/Compliance:** Standard security best practices will be followed, including password hashing and protecting routes based on user roles (Buyer, Store Manager, Admin).

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Constraints**
*   **Timeline:** The project must be completed within the timeframe of the software engineering internship.
*   **Resources:** The project will be developed by a single developer, leveraging AI tools (e.g., Gemini, GitHub Copilot) to accelerate the process.
*   **Technical:** The technology stack is fixed to Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL, React, and React Native as specified. No other frameworks or libraries should be introduced without a strong justification.

**Key Assumptions**
*   It is assumed that the developer has foundational knowledge of the chosen technologies.
*   It is assumed that the AI development tools will be available and accessible throughout the project.
*   It is assumed that the provided project requirements and our brainstorming decisions are stable and will not undergo major changes, ensuring the MVP scope remains fixed.
*   It is assumed that a "good enough" design can be achieved using a standard component library (like Material-UI or Ant Design) without the need for a dedicated UX/UI designer.

## Risks & Open Questions

**Key Risks**
*   **Integration Complexity:** The risk that connecting the frontend (React/React Native) to the backend (FastAPI) proves more time-consuming than anticipated, potentially delaying the project.
*   **State Management:** The risk that managing a shared state between the web and mobile applications using Redux becomes complex, especially with cart synchronization.
*   **Time Management:** The risk that underestimating the time required for a specific feature could jeopardize the completion of the full MVP scope within the internship timeline.

**Open Questions**
*   Which specific UI component library (e.g., Material-UI, Ant Design, or something else) will be chosen for the frontend? This decision will impact the overall look and feel.
*   What is the detailed deployment strategy? How will the FastAPI backend, the React frontend, and the PostgreSQL database be hosted?
*   How will database migrations be handled as the schema evolves?
