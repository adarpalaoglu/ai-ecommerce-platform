# Wireframes & Mockups

This section clarifies where detailed visual designs will be created (e.g., Figma, Sketch, etc.) and how to reference them. If low-fidelity wireframes are needed, I can help conceptualize layouts for key screens, focusing on functional placement of elements rather than detailed visual aesthetics.

### 4.1 Design Files

**Question:** Where will the primary design files for Barem be hosted or created (e.g., Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, Miro, etc.)? Please provide a general link or a description of how they will be referenced.

### 4.2 Key Screen Layouts

This subsection will functionally describe the layout of key screens, focusing on the placement of major UI elements.

### 4.2.1 Key Screen Layout: Product Detail Page

**Functional Layout Description:**

The Product Detail Page is functionally divided into several key areas to present product information and enable user actions.

*   **Top Area (Header & Navigation):**
    *   The standard site-wide header (Barem logo, search, user utilities) and primary navigation remain consistent at the top.
*   **Main Content Area:**
    *   **Left Section (Product Media):** Occupies a significant portion of the left side. This area is dedicated to displaying the primary product image. Below or beside it, a functional carousel or grid of smaller thumbnail images allows users to view alternate angles or variations of the product.
    *   **Right Section (Product Information & Actions):** Occupies the right side, adjacent to the product media. This section contains:
        *   **Product Title:** Prominently displayed at the top of this section.
        *   **Price:** Located directly below the title.
        *   **Brief Description:** A concise summary of the product's key features.
        *   **Action Block:** Contains the core interaction elements:
            *   **Quantity Selector:** An input field or set of buttons to adjust the desired quantity.
            *   **"Add to Cart" Button:** A primary call-to-action button.
            *   **"Buy It Now" Button:** A secondary call-to-action button for direct purchase.
        *   **Availability/Stock Information:** Indicates if the product is in stock and potentially the quantity remaining.
    *   **Lower Section (Detailed Description):** Spans the full width below the main product media and information panel. This area provides a comprehensive, detailed description of the product's specifications, features, and benefits.
    *   **Bottom Section (Related Products):** Located below the detailed description. This section displays a functional grid or carousel of "You May Also Like" products, each with an image, name, and price, providing cross-selling opportunities.
*   **Bottom Area (Footer):**
    *   The standard site-wide footer remains consistent at the bottom of the page.

**Rationale:**
*   This layout prioritizes the product image and key purchase actions, making them immediately visible upon page load.
*   The separation of media and information allows for efficient scanning.
*   The detailed description and related products are placed lower, accessible for users seeking more information or alternative options.
