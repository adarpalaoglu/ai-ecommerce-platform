# Animation & Micro-interactions

Animations and micro-interactions will be used sparingly and purposefully to enhance the user experience, provide feedback, and guide attention, without being distracting.

*   **Motion Principles:** Animations will be subtle, fast, and functional, avoiding excessive or gratuitous motion. They will aim to provide clarity and delight.
*   **Key Animations:**
    *   **Loading Indicators:** Subtle animations (e.g., spinners, skeleton loaders) to indicate data fetching.
    *   **Button Feedback:** Visual feedback (e.g., slight scale, color change) on button clicks/hovers.
    *   **Cart Updates:** Subtle animations to confirm items added to cart or quantity changes.
    *   **Page Transitions:** Smooth transitions between pages to improve perceived performance.
