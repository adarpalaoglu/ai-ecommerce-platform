Based on the "User Interface Design Goals" section of the PRD, here are the core UX goals and design principles for Barem:

*   **Key Interaction Paradigms:**
    *   **Browsing:** Standard grid-based layout for product listings with clear filtering and sorting.
    *   **Search:** Prominent search bar leading to a dedicated results page.
    *   **Cart Management:** Quick additions via mini-cart/slide-out, full-page view for review.
    *   **Checkout:** Linear, multi-step process for shipping and payment.
*   **Core Screens and Views:** Homepage, Shop/Product Listing, Product Detail, Shopping Cart, User Account (Login, Registration, Order History), Store Manager Dashboard (Product & Order Management).
*   **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.
*   **Branding:** Minimal and modern, focusing on clean typography and a simple color palette to highlight product imagery.
*   **Target Platforms:** Responsive web application (desktop and mobile browsers) and a separate React Native mobile application.
