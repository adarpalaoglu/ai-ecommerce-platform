# Performance Considerations

Performance will be a key consideration in the UI/UX design, ensuring a fast and responsive user experience.

*   **Performance Goals:**
    *   **Page Load:** Main browsing and product pages should load under 3 seconds on a standard internet connection (as per PRD NFR2).
    *   **Interaction Response:** UI interactions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions) should have immediate visual feedback.
    *   **Animation FPS:** Animations should run smoothly at 60 frames per second where applicable.
*   **Design Strategies:**
    *   **Optimized Imagery:** Images will be optimized for web (appropriate formats, compression, lazy loading).
    *   **Efficient Animations:** Animations will be designed to be performant, avoiding complex effects that can cause jank.
    *   **Minimalist Design:** The clean and simple aesthetic naturally contributes to better performance by reducing visual clutter and complex rendering.
    *   **Progressive Loading:** Content may be loaded progressively to improve perceived performance.
