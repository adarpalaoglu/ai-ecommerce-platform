# Branding & Style Guide

This section will link to existing style guides or define key brand elements. It ensures consistency with company brand guidelines if they exist.

### 6.1 Visual Identity

**Question:** Is there an existing brand guidelines document or a link to one that defines Barem's visual identity (e.g., logo usage, overall aesthetic principles)? If not, we can functionally state that the visual identity will be derived from the "minimal and modern" vision outlined in the PRD.

### 6.2 Color Palette

The color palette for Barem will be minimalistic and modern, designed to be appealing and subtle, allowing product imagery and key actions to stand out.

*   **Primary Color:** A soft, clean **White** (e.g., `#F8F8F8` or similar) for primary backgrounds, content areas, and main elements, providing a sense of spaciousness and clarity.
*   **Secondary Color:** A subtle, complementary **Gray** (e.g., `#E0E0E0` or similar) for secondary backgrounds, borders, and less prominent UI elements, adding depth without distraction.
*   **Accent Color:** A vibrant **Green** (e.g., `#4CAF50` or similar) specifically reserved for primary calls to action like "Buy Now" buttons, and other key interactive elements that require immediate user attention.
*   **Neutral Colors:**
    *   **White:** (`#FFFFFF`) for crisp, clean elements and text backgrounds.
    *   **Black/Dark Gray:** (`#212121` or similar) for primary text, headings, and strong contrasts.
    *   **Medium Gray:** (`#757575` or similar) for secondary text, icons, and subtle dividers.
    *   **Light Gray:** (`#BDBDBD` or similar) for disabled states, borders, and subtle backgrounds.
*   **Functional Colors:**
    *   **Success:** A clear, positive **Green** (e.g., `#4CAF50` or similar).
    *   **Warning:** A distinct **Orange** (e.g., `#FF9800` or similar).
    *   **Error:** A strong **Red** (e.g., `#F44336` or similar).

## 6.3 Typography

Barem will utilize a clean and modern typography system, prioritizing readability and visual hierarchy.

*   **Font Families:**
    *   **Primary:** A modern sans-serif font (e.g., Roboto, Open Sans, Lato) for headings and body text, chosen for its readability across various screen sizes.
    *   **Secondary:** (Optional) A complementary sans-serif font for specific elements or a slightly different weight/style of the primary font.
    *   **Monospace:** A standard monospace font (e.g., Inconsolata, Fira Code) for code snippets or technical displays if needed.
*   **Type Scale:** A well-defined type scale will ensure consistent and hierarchical text sizing.
    *   **H1:** Large, bold for main page titles.
    *   **H2-H6:** Progressively smaller for section titles and subheadings.
    *   **Body:** Standard size for main content text.
    *   **Small:** Smaller size for captions, legal text, and less prominent information.
*   **Weights:** A limited set of font weights (e.g., Regular, Medium, Bold) will be used to maintain visual consistency and clarity.

## 6.4 Iconography

Barem will use a consistent and clear set of icons to enhance usability and visual communication.

*   **Icon Library:** A well-established icon library (e.g., Material Icons, Font Awesome, Feather Icons) will be adopted to ensure consistency, scalability (SVG), and ease of use.
*   **Usage Guidelines:** Icons will be used sparingly and purposefully, primarily to:
    *   Represent common actions (e.g., search, cart, user profile).
    *   Aid navigation (e.g., arrows, menu toggles).
    *   Provide visual cues (e.g., success/error indicators).
    *   Maintain a consistent visual style (line-based or filled, consistent stroke weight).

## 6.5 Spacing & Layout

A systematic approach to spacing and layout will ensure visual harmony, readability, and responsiveness.

*   **Grid System:** A flexible 12-column grid system will be used to structure content and ensure consistent alignment across different screen sizes.
*   **Spacing Scale:** A defined spacing scale (e.g., based on multiples of 4px or 8px) will be applied for margins, padding, and gaps between elements, promoting visual rhythm and consistency.
*   **Layout Adaptations:** Content will adapt fluidly to different screen sizes, utilizing responsive design principles (fluid grids, flexible images, media queries).
