# Responsiveness Strategy

Barem will be a responsive web application, adapting its layout and content to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.

*   **Breakpoints:** Standard breakpoints will be defined for common device categories:
    *   **Mobile:** (e.g., up to 767px)
    *   **Tablet:** (e.g., 768px to 1023px)
    *   **Desktop:** (e.g., 1024px and above)
*   **Adaptation Patterns:**
    *   **Layout Changes:** Content columns will reflow, stack, or adjust their width based on screen size.
    *   **Navigation Changes:** Primary navigation may collapse into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
    *   **Content Priority:** Less critical content may be hidden or reordered on smaller screens to prioritize essential information.
    *   **Interaction Changes:** Touch-friendly interactions will be prioritized on mobile devices.
