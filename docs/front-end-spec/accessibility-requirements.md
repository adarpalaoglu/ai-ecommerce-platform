# Accessibility Requirements

Barem will aim for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance to ensure the application is usable by a wide range of people, including those with disabilities.

*   **Compliance Target:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA.
*   **Key Requirements:**
    *   **Visual:**
        *   Color contrast ratios: Minimum 4.5:1 for text and interactive elements.
        *   Focus indicators: Clear visual indicators for keyboard focus on interactive elements.
        *   Text sizing: Users can resize text up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.
    *   **Interaction:**
        *   Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements are operable via keyboard alone, with a logical tab order.
        *   Screen reader support: Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes will be used to ensure content is understandable by screen readers.
        *   Touch targets: Sufficiently large and spaced touch targets for mobile interactions.
    *   **Content:**
        *   Alternative text: All meaningful images will have descriptive alt text.

        *   Form labels: All form fields will have associated, visible labels.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Accessibility will be integrated into the development and QA process, including automated checks, manual testing with assistive technologies, and user testing with diverse users.
